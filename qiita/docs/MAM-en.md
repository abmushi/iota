Deep Dive into MAM: the IoT-ic feature of IOTA

# Preface
 MAM(Masked Authenticated Message) is one of the Beta services but must call more attentions from developers. Currently, IOTA officially is developing the newest version of MAM at [here](https://github.com/iotaledger/MAM) in Rust. However, this article explains the older and deprecated version of MAM written in [Javascript](https://github.com/iotaledger/mam.client.js). Since the big picture and algorithm used in both version are quite similar and considerring there are few articles available online that disclose the blackbox behind what MAM does, I think the deprecated explanation of MAM is still useful for many potential developers to understand MAM and widen the prospective frontier. 

# MAM
 IOTA boasts of its zero transaction fee. Also, each transaction object could contain a **signatureFragment** of 2187 length. MAM's first basic idea is that by encrypting the signatureFragment, one could easily claim cloud storage on Tangle, which in MAM is called **Channel**. And key that encrypts and decrypts it is called **Channel Key**. If you want to publish your channel available to public, you could just make your Channel Key public. If not, let it hide and never tell anybodies. The Channel Key can be chosen by channel owner arbitrarly.
 
 Publicized message on channel is stored at the address on the Tangle. Like you search your address balance in [Tangle Explorer](https://iotasear.ch/), you can read your encrypted message there. With corresponding Channel Key, you can understand it.

## MAM summary
 MAM is often said to be like a radio, where Only who knows the radio frequency may reach the message. In MAM, only who knows the Channel Key can view the message.
> Major points
>1. **Encrypting** raw message with Channel Key.
>2. Only who knows **Channel Key** can decrypt message.
>3. Knowing the Channel Key is not enough to be a Channel owner. To publicize message on channel, you need channel owner's seed.
>4. From older to newer, the message is stored in the form of the chain generated chronologically. And the message chain may fork.
>5. If you join the channel message chain at some point, you cannot look back to see the past message.

Detail will be explained later.

### In Practice
In practice, MAM would be used in:
>1. **IoT data flow management**：You could collect data from small sensors and devices in the factory. And those collected data can be encrypted and posted to DLT, Tangle. You can hold public availability and security at the same time.
>2. **Group chat**：Knowing channel keys of each other, they can chat.（Alpha available called [iota1k](https://github.com/xx10t4/iota1k) is being developed.）

## Older MAM and Newer MAM
 As I notified above. This article explains the older MAM. But, for those who are interested in newer, jump to this [link](https://blog.iota.org/introducing-masked-authenticated-messaging-e55c1822d50e).

                console.log("Public key match for " + root);
            }
            console.log("received: " + asciiMessage);
        });

    }
});

```
# Behind MAM - Overview
## Channel Key - `channelKey`
　`chennelKey` is an arbitrary 81 trytes, like seed. First of all, publisher publish first `message`. The `message` is encrypted with the `channelKey`. In this way, no one other than this publisher can understand the `message`.

![mam_channelKey_basic.png](https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/187795/1459dbff-a02b-fc6c-bdb9-1caaa89844c7.png)

　However, in this way, you can only publish message once on your channel. In other words, one 'channelKey' can reach only one message. If you post new message on the channel, whenever you do so, you have to tell your viewer the new Channel Key. And you have to store all channel key safely and keep track of them which to which. It can be a mess.

## Image of Solution
　Let me explain to you with easy image for now. That might ignore small negligible details. (Don't worry for those with interests in minute detail, I will eventually explain.)
### Next Channel Key - `nextChannelKey`
　Before encrypting your raw message, MAM includes the **next channel key(`nextChannelKey`)** in your message to be encrypted. If to say in RPG, in the first treasure chest you opened, it's like you would find the key that opens next treasure chest. By repeating this can viewers sequently decrypt next `message` with `nextChannelKey` you obtained from current `message` you have just decrypted. And publisher can give `nextChannelKey` of any points on the channel. That way, you can restrict viewers from viewing the past messages.
 \*`nextChannelKey` can be arbitrary 81 trytes.

![mam_nextKey_1.png](https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/187795/035bba8e-d285-3a61-265d-f3fcf9e1b5fc.png)

### Address of the message - `messageID`
　You might have ever noticed, you have your key but don't have the map that guides you to the treasure chest. In technical term, having `channelKey` or `nextChannelKey` is no use to find where the message is stored. 
 In MAM, the address where the message is stored is called `messageID`. And it is simply generated by hashing `channelKey` or `nextChannelKey` twice. The  treasure map is drawn on the key. Just having your key is suffucient for both finding and decrpting message.

![mam_messageID1.png](https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/187795/24322eb3-93d4-b82e-2afd-4d9fd58ae6eb.png)

\* The way to generate `messageID` is arbitrary as long as you and potential viewers share how to. But, at least you should hash it to protect your key.

### Message Chain
　The genesis `message` that contains raw message and `nextChannelKey` of the channel encrypted with `channelKey` will be a part of the bundle. And the bundle that contain next `message` is pointed by the previous bundle. By repeating this, you can now see a chain on the Tangle, **Message Chain**. You can join message chain at any points with corresponding key to decrypt it, but never can go back to see past posts.

## Implimentaion in Practice
 Now the time to see what's in practice. Reality is always somewhat different than blueprint.
 At first, it is costly to encryt `message` to get `nextChannelKey`. If you are interested in the newest post of the channel, but only to realize it has hundreds of the previous posts. Decrypting all of them just to view one last post is not realistically feasible. So, in practice, instead of having `nextChannelKey` encrypted IN the `message` with raw message, `nextChannelKey` is generated by the formula `nextChannelKey = hash(channelKey + salt)` ,where `salt` is an arbitrary `tag` of the Transaction object chosen when posting the message. Since the `tag` is a part of the Transaction object, to know `tag` you need `messageID`(address) the transaction is stored. And the transaction can be found only with `channelKey`. Note that this way still holds MAM's restriction, only who knows `channelKey` can know `nextChannelKey`.
 
　If to say in the treasure chest analogy, next key is not in the chest, but attached to the surface of the chest. But, only who brought the key can see the next key.
 
![mam_next_key_tx.png](https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/187795/af4df8f3-9a12-e897-4d47-a247be596586.png)

　Moreover, if the `message` exceeds the capacity(2187 trytes) of the `signatureFragment` of the Transaction, you don't need to make two different MAM messages and post twice as two messages on the message chain. You can just increase the number of transactions stored in the bundle and attach the bundle with long message as one MAM message. But, too long bundle may require too heavy PoW to attach it to the Tangle and it's also costly when retrieve it from the Tangle.
 
# Behind MAM - Publishing
　Now I'm going to talk about the forgotten aspect of the MAM, Channel's ownership. Let's take a look at the case below.

 Alice has just published her first message on her channel and want Bob to read her post. So, Alice gave him her `channelKey`. Bob visited her message by generating address(=`messageID`) and decrypt it with `channelKey`. Bob enjoyed her post and thought "wanna read next!". And he has `nextChannelKey` in the decrypted current message, and can generate next address out of it. But, he realized that Alice hasn't published next message yet, at next `messageID`, there're no transactions made.
 Bob suddenly became evil. He has `nextChannelKey` and next `messageID`. He can post his message encrypted with `nextChannelKey` to the address `messageID`. And he could hijack Alice's channel.
 Do you think it would work? From information explained so far, there's no contradiction.
...However, that's MAM's failure. Don't worry, MAM is designed so people like Bob cannot jumble up the channel. Next topic to cover is how Alice keeps her message chain from being edited by anyone else.

## Channel's ownnership
　The problems mentioned above could simply be summarized as:**Chennel Key implimentation cannot identify who of Alice and Bob owns messages.**
　Now recall how the address of IOTA is signed by its proper owner.ここでIOTAにおける、アドレスの残高の所有権はどう証明したかを思い出してみよう。アドレスの残高を引き出す際には、Seedから生成される**Private Key**で[署名](https://qiita.com/ABmushi/items/422d1bf94be0c919583a#%E7%BD%B2%E5%90%8D%E3%81%AE%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95)したトランザクションが承認されることで残高を引き出すことができた。
　MAM uses technic that utilizes both Private Key and Merkle Tree scheme to prove ownership of the channel.

## Merkle tree based signature scheme 
　[Merkle tree based signature scheme](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2013/07/18/hashsig.html) is the technic used in MAM.
　But, I don't explain what the computer science term "Merkle Tree" is. Because since interests in Cryptos skyrocket, the idea of the merkle tree, which is the core module often seen in plenty of cryoto projects, is explained countless times at various places. You could just google it.
 
### Merkle Tree create
Source [here](https://github.com/iotaledger/mam.client.js/blob/master/lib/merkle.js#L54)
Merkle Tree of MAM is generated from seed. (What a surprise that seed grows up to a tree!) Merkle Tree has two parameters, `start` and `size`. `start` is used as a parameter `index` of creating private key. And `size` is used to specify the range in the sequence of the private key generation. To illustrate, look at the figure below. A,B,C,D are the private keys generated with `index` parameters as 0,1,2,3(where `start = 0`). And A',B',C',D' are the address generated out of each private key.

![mam_merkle_1-2.png](https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/187795/06ea21b7-6427-90b4-1c82-4a64c53a0df1.png)

　Leaf of the merkle tree, A",B",C",D" are `=hash(address)`. From leaf to root, hash of children nodes are merged into their parent node. Obviously, you cannot generate children nodes from parent.

### Siblings
　Let's say, leaf `A'` is given, to obtain root, you need to have all other leaves `B'C'D'`. But, if you cannot access to those, how do you get root? **Siblings** are the complimentary hashes that are necessary to generate `root` with given leaf. Look at the figure below.
 
![mam_2_siblings_2.png](https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/187795/c3f7d1b4-984b-d4a1-d054-e788fe2a7a10.png)

　For the case leaf is `A'`, siblings are `B"`and `Hash(C"D")`. Without knowing all leaves, with siblings, you can calculate `root`.

### Secret Key and Public Key
　Publisher(Seed owner) has to make Private Keys, A,B,C,D confidential. But, `root` and `siblings` are public keys, because you can still achieve your private key's safety. Because, only the seed owner, or to say Merkle Tree owner, can calculate `root` from public information. Other cannot generate `root`. Yes, they know what the `root` is, but they don't know how to generate. To illustrate, using the example above, other people must have a **leaf `A'`** to generate `root` by combining it with also public `siblings`. This way, you can distinguish correct owner of the merkle tree from other folks.
 
　![mam_2_merkle_pubkey.png](https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/187795/42e5b069-c3bf-333e-2d9f-84b7fa916bcb.png)
　
　This technic is magically used in MAM to prove ownership of the message chain.

# Behind MAM - Signature and Validation
　In this chapter, I'm going to merge two major topics discussed so far:
>1. Message Chain connected via nextChannelKey
>2. Merkle Tree

## MAM.create
source [here](https://github.com/iotaledger/mam.client.js/blob/master/lib/mam.js#L63)
　Alice opens Channel. Alice then has to:
>1. generate `channelKey`.
>2. generate two Merkle Trees of same `size`. The first one starts with the index `start`.

　The first tree namely `tree0`, has `start0 = start`,`size0 = size`. Second tree `tree1` starts with `start1 = srart0 + size0`, `size1 - size0`. Second tree uses next sequence of the private keys. Figure below.
 
![mam_2_double_merkle.png](https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/187795/67d5fc56-b28f-4d91-65c5-9a56b416d240.png)
　
  When creating MAM,`tree0` itself and the root of `tree1`, namely `root_1`(**nextRoot**) is one of the parameters. And **leaf index** is chosen from **0 < i <size**. Let's say in this case, `leaf_index = 0`. Leaf index of the merkle tree is the distance from the most left leaf. leaf_index '0' of `tree0` is `A'`, leaf_index `2` of `tree1` is `G'`.
  
```java:example of MAM.create
leaf_index = 0    // leaf index

const mam = new MAM.create({
    message: iota.utils.toTrytes(message),  // convert raw message to tryte
    merkleTree: tree0,                      // the first merkle tree
    index: leaf_index,                      // leaf index
    nextRoot: tree1.root.hash.toString(),   // next root. root_1 above.
    channelKey: channelKey,                 // ChannelKey, used to encrypt this whole message.
});
```
 So, what's going to happen in MAM.create then?
 
 Firstly, create **siblings** of `tree0` with `index = leaf_index`. In this case, `leaf_index = 0`, so `siblings` are `B"` and `Hash(C"D")`. 
![mam_2_small_sib.png](https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/187795/d67e16e9-7ad9-d54e-4ba6-978af070fc0d.png)
 Nextly, make a signature, where `messageTrytes` that are composite of `nextRoot` and raw_message as signed data, and private key of `leaf_index` as signing key. 署名作成については[こちら](https://qiita.com/ABmushi/items/422d1bf94be0c919583a#%E7%BD%B2%E5%90%8D%E3%81%AE%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95)でも説明したが、それを踏まえて下図のように署名は作られる。
![mam_2_sig2.png](https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/187795/5c4af53b-d673-6e3b-b71b-ee9778df1335.png)
　Now with these given attributes, one MAM message is created. This is visulaized below.
![mam_2_overview_single.png](https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/187795/bc220ff5-85ff-8cfe-2fac-0cadf57b32d1.png)
## MAM.parse
source [here](https://github.com/iotaledger/mam.client.js/blob/master/lib/mam.js#L131)
　So, how we parse this message?
### Tell viewer both `channelKey` and `root`
>**chennelKey** is used to decrypt message, and for generating `address`.
>**root** is used as *ownership verification checker* to check decrypted message is of A or not.

In this example, `root_0` of `tree0` and `channelKey` is given to viewers so that they can understand A's first published message. Now, assume that Bob has been given both `root_0` and `chennelKey`.
　Bob calculates `messageID` from given `channelKey` to find where Alice's message is being stored. Then, decrypt found message with `channelKey`.
　Next, he validates signature of the message with `messageTrytes` as signed data.署名の承認の仕方は[こちら](https://qiita.com/ABmushi/items/422d1bf94be0c919583a#%E6%89%BF%E8%AA%8D%E3%81%AE%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95%E3%82%A2%E3%83%89%E3%83%AC%E3%82%B9%E3%81%AE%E9%80%86%E7%94%9F%E6%88%90)。

　![mam_2_sig_address.png](https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/187795/464abb92-1775-8faa-8870-bf8e86fe2df9.png)
### Ownership Verification
　After validation of th signature, Bob gets an address. He uses the address as a leaf at `leaf_index` of the merkle tree. Then with given `siblings` in the message, he finds `root` of the merkle tree. If this `root` matches the root Alice told him, the decrypted message is proved to be made by Alice.
![mam_2_address_merkle.png](https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/187795/052d06e5-640a-6c12-5467-df1751d0a1db.png)
　If not, that means signed data `messageTrytes` is different than Alice's. So, the address generated by validating singnature is also going to be different. Then with that address, calculated with `siblings`, he gets `root`. This `root` does not match the root Alice gave him.
 In this way, malicious attackers who know the channel key at any points on the message chain cannot generate fake message on the chain. Precisely, they can post fake message on the address `messageID`, but when viewers decrypt the fake message, because they cannot match their given `root`, fake message is never going to be regarded as Alice's real message.
 
## nextRoot
　As I mentioned, MAM is a message chain. One message decryption has to lead to next message. Finding next message is the role of `nextChannelKey`, but what about the checking ownership of the next message? Each `messageTrytes` contain the value `nextRoot` stored with raw message. This `nextRoot` is used to check the validity of the next message in the same way as explained in previous chapter. The you generate `nextRoot`, the larger index is used as `start` of the merkle tree.
　Remember `nextChannelKey` is to find the address and decrypt next message, `nextRoot` is used to compare with caluculated `root` of the next message, which has `siblings` and `leaf_index` in it.

# Chain fork
　MAM's message chain may fork.
　By changing `leaf_index` and coressponding `siblings`, you could post different message that still holds your ownership. In this way, at the same address `messageID`, you could have your message as many as the merkle tree's `size`.
　And `nextChannelKey` can be generated in different way such that forked chain will follow different `messageID` path.

## Use case
　I came up with how to use forking message chain. You may see forking chain as the tree structure of the directory, where the first published message as root directory and children are generated by forking chain. And telling users different channel keys at differnt points on the chain, you can manage access controll. The users close to superuser knows the channel key that opens closer message to the first message.
 
# MAM is Protocol
　You might have noticed that by changing the way to hash to calculate root, channel key, siblings and etc.. As long as you share how to post and parse messages with your viewers, you can have different format of MAM. The MAM explained in this article is just one of all possible MAMs.
